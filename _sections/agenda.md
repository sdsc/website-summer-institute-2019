| 8:00 – 8:30AM | Coffee | |
| 8:30 – 12:00PM | **Python for HPC** <br/> _Andrea Zonca, Senior Computational Scientist, SDSC_ <br/> In this session we will introduce four key technologies in the Python ecosystem that provide significant benefits for scientific applications run in supercomputing environments. Previous Python experience is recommended but not required. (1) The Jupyter Notebook allows users to execute code on a single compute node through a local browser for interactive data exploration and visualization. The Jupyter Notebook supports live Python code, explanatory text, LaTeX equations and plots in the same document. (2) IPython Parallel provides a simple, flexible and scalable way of running thousands of Python serial jobs by spawning IPython kernels (namely engines) on any HPC batch scheduler. (3) Numba makes it possible to run pure Python code on GPUs simply by decorating functions with the data types of the input and output arguments. Pure Python prototype code can be gradually optimized by pushing the most computationally intensive functions to the GPU without the need to implement code in CUDA or OpenCL. (4) Dask is a flexible parallel computing library that allows to build a distributed computation using simple operators and then let the library automatically handle distributing data, executing the computation hierarchically and gather back the results.  | **A Short Introduction to Data Science and its Applications** <br/> _Ilkay Altintas, SDSC's Chief Data Science Officer, SDSC_ <br/> _Amarnath Gupta, Dir. of Advanced Query Processing Lab, SDSC_ <br/> _Ilya Zaslavsky, Dr. Spatial Information Systems Lab, SDSC_ <br/> The new era of data science is here. Our lives as well as any field of science, engineering, business and society are continuously transformed by our ability to collect meaningful data in a systematic fashion and turn that into value.  These needs not only push for new and innovative capabilities in composable data management and analytical methods that can scale in an anytime anywhere fashion, but also require methods to bridge the gap between applications and compose such capabilities within solution architectures. In this short overview, we will show you a plethora of applications that are enabled by data science techniques and describe the process and cyberinfrastructure used within these projects to solve questions. We will also overview SDSC's AWESOME and SUAVE platforms for data management and visualization. Particularly, in this session, you will learn about: (1)the basis process of data science, (2) reference solution architectures for computational data science, (3) the data management challenges when deal with steaming data, (4) how social media datasets can be used within scienftific studies, (5) graph analysis at scale, (6) effectively applying basic statistical analysis and machine learning methods to survey data, (7) examples for visualization of datasets through various end user platforms  |
| 12:00 – 1:30 PM | Lunch at Café Ventanas | |
| 1:30 - 5:00 PM | **Performance Tuning** <br/> _Bob Sinkovits, Director for Scientific Computing Applications, SDSC_ <br/> This session is targeted at attendees who both do their own code development and need their calculations to finish as quickly as possible. We&#39;ll cover the effective use of cache, loop-level optimizations, force reductions, optimizing compilers and their limitations, short-circuiting, time-space tradeoffs and more. Exercises will be done mostly in C, but emphasis will be on general techniques that can be applied in any language.  | **Information Visualization**<br/>  _Amit Chourasia, Senior Visualizaton Scientist, SDSC_ <br/> This tutorial will provide a ground up understanding of information visualization concepts and how they can be leveraged to select and use effective visual idioms for different data types such spreadsheet data, geospatial, graph, etc.).

| 8:00 – 8:30 AM | Coffee |
| 8:30 – 10:00 AM | **Introduction to Research Data Management Using Globus** <br/>_Rick Wagner, Globus Professional Services Manager, Globus_ <br/>Globus is a research data management service developed by the University of Chicago and used by thousands of researchers at institutions in the US and abroad. You will learn about Globus capabilities from the perspective of a researcher, systems administrator, and application developer.  This session will start with a high-level introduction to all aspects of the Globus service, including the web application, command line interface, and platform-as-a-service. Then we’ll review common use cases and demonstrate how the Globus command line interface (CLI) and API may be used to automate repetitive data management tasks, how to use Globus Auth to provide authentication and fine-grained authorization for accessing your own services, and how Globus may be used in conjunction with the Jupyter platform to open up new avenues in interactive data science.|
| 10:15 - 11:45 AM | **SeedMe2: Creating data centric websites for researchers and research projects** <br/> _Amit Chourasia, Senior Visualization Scientist, SDSC_ <br/> Data is an integral part of scientific research. With a rapid growth in data collection and generation capability and an increasingly collaborative nature of research activities, data management and data sharing have become central and key to accomplishing research goals. Researchers today have variety of solutions at their disposal from local storage to Cloud based storage. However, most of these solutions focus on hierarchical file and folder organization. While such an organization is pervasively used and quite useful, it relegates information about the data such as description and collaborative notes about the data to external systems. This spread of information into different silos impedes the flow research activities.  In this tutorial, we will introduce and provide hands on experience with the NSF supported SeedMe2 platform, which provides a web-based data management and data sharing cyberinfrastructure. Attendees will learn how to setup and explore its capabilities and potential for practical use. |
